RESTful api is work on the server - client architecture

RESTful APIs are a set of architectural principles and constraints used for designing networked applications.
 They are based on the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). 
 RESTful APIs allow clients to interact with server resources using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

To implement a RESTful API, you can use a framework or library in your preferred programming language. 
Some popular options include Express.js for Node.js, Django for Python, and Ruby on Rails for Ruby.

When designing a RESTful API, it's important to follow best practices such as using meaningful resource URIs, 
using appropriate HTTP status codes, and supporting content negotiation for different data formats.

By implementing a RESTful API, you can create a scalable and interoperable system that can be easily consumed by different clients, 
including web browsers, mobile apps, and other servers.
